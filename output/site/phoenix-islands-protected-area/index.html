<p>The <span class="caps">UNESCO</span> World Heritage Committee issued the following Statement of Outstanding Universal Value at the time of&nbsp;inscription:</p>
<p><strong>Brief&nbsp;Synthesis</strong></p>
<p>As a vast expanse of largely pristine mid-ocean environment, replete with a suite of largely intact uninhabited atolls, truly an oceanic wilderness, the Phoenix Islands Protected Area (<span class="caps">PIPA</span>) (408,250 sq km), the largest marine protected area in the Pacific, is globally exceptional and as such is a superlative natural phenomenon of global&nbsp;importance.</p>
<p><span class="caps">PIPA</span> contains an outstanding collection of large submerged volcanoes, presumed extinct, rising direct from the extensive deep sea floor with an average depth of more than 4,500 metres and a maximum depth of over 6,000 metres. Included are no less than 14 recognised seamounts, submerged mountains that don&rsquo;t penetrate to the surface. The collection of atolls and reef islands represent coral reef capping on 8 other volcanic mountains that approach the surface. The large bathymetric range of the submerged seamount landscape provides depth defined habitat types fully representative of the mid oceanic biota. Due to its great isolation, <span class="caps">PIPA</span> occupies a unique position in the biogeography of the Pacific as a critical stepping stone habitat for migratory and pelagic/planktonic species and for ocean currents in the region. <span class="caps">PIPA</span> embraces the full range of marine environments in this area and displays high levels of marine abundance as well as the full spectrum of age and size cohorts, increasingly rare in the tropics, and especially in the case of apex predator fish, sea turtles, sea birds, corals, giant clams, and coconut crabs, many of which have been depleted elsewhere. The overall marine tropic dynamics for these island communities across this archipelago are better functioning (relatively intact) compared with other island systems where human habitation and exploitation has significantly altered the environment. The complete representation of ocean and island environments and their connectivity, the remoteness and naturalness are important attributes which contribute to the outstanding universal&nbsp;value.</p>
<p><strong>Criterion (vii):</strong> <span class="caps">PIPA</span>, an oceanic wilderness, is sufficiently remote and inhospitable to human colonisation as to be exceptional in terms of the minimal evidence of the impacts of human activities both on the atolls and in the adjacent seas. <span class="caps">PIPA</span> is a very large protected area, a vast wilderness domain where nature prevails and man is but an occasional visitor. <span class="caps">PIPA</span> is distinguished by containing a large suite of seamounts complete with a broad expanse of contextual abyssal plain with a natural phenomenon of global significance. The essentially pristine environment, outstanding underwater clarity, the spectacle of large groups of charismatic aquatic animals (e.g. bumphead parrotfish, Napolean wrasse, surgeonfishes, parrotfishes, groupers, maori wrasse, sharks, turtles, dolphins, manta rays, giant clams) in quantities rarely found elsewhere in the world, aesthetically outstanding coral reef features (e.g. giant clams, large coral heads) together with the spectacle of huge concentrations of seabirds on remote atolls, makes <span class="caps">PIPA</span> a truly kaleidoscopic natural &ldquo;oceanscape&rdquo; exhibiting exceptional natural beauty of global&nbsp;significance.</p>
<p><strong>Criterion (ix):</strong> With its rich biota, as a known breeding site for numerous nomadic, migratory and pelagic marine and terrestrial species, and the known and predicted high level of biodiversity and endemicity associated with these isolated mid-ocean atolls, submerged reefs and seamounts, <span class="caps">PIPA</span> makes an outstanding contribution to ongoing ecological and biological processes in the evolution and development of global marine ecosystems and communities of plants and animals. <span class="caps">PIPA</span> has exceptional value as a natural laboratory for the study and understanding of the significant ongoing ecological and biological processes in the evolution and development of marine ecosystems of the Pacific, the world&rsquo;s largest ocean, indeed all oceans. <span class="caps">PIPA</span> is of crucial scientific importance in identifying and monitoring the processes of sea level change, growth rates and age of reefs and reef builders, (both geologically and historically) and in evaluating effects from climate&nbsp;change.</p>
<p><strong>Integrity</strong></p>
<p><span class="caps">PIPA</span>&rsquo;s boundaries are clearly defined. The boundaries are mostly straight lines with some adjustments to the boundaries to align with the Exclusive Economic Zone (<span class="caps">200NM</span>) of Kiribati. There are various clearly delimited zones within <span class="caps">PIPA</span> as described in the Management Plan. <span class="caps">PIPA</span>&rsquo;s large size and full inclusion of oceanic and island habitats in this area and coverage of numerous examples of key habitats (coral reefs, islands, seamounts) together with its predominantly natural state give exceptional conservation importance. Despite some human impacts (fishing, invasive species) the integrity of the property and oceanic ecosystems processes at scale are globally outstanding for island archipelagos and most other tropical marine environments found&nbsp;worldwide.</p>
<p><strong>Protection and Management&nbsp;Requirements</strong></p>
<p><span class="caps">PIPA</span> is a highly protected area fully legally established under the <span class="caps">PIPA</span> Regulations 2008. These regulations include provision of a management plan and clear permitting processes and rules for activities allowable within the site. The 2010-2014 <span class="caps">PIPA</span> Management Plan, endorsed by Kiribati&rsquo;s cabinet in 2009 is under implementation. Management capacity and success is steadily building and Kiribati is using a &ldquo;whole of government approach with partners&rdquo; to ensure a management system that is sustainable and suitable to the circumstances of a small developing state. Of particular note is the success in capture and fining of illegal fishing vessels and in the removal of invasive species from globally important islands for seabird&nbsp;conservation.</p>
<p>For long term sustainability Kiribati and its partners are committed to a <span class="caps">PIPA</span> Trust Fund. The Fund&rsquo;s legislation, the Board and by-laws are all now in place and 2.5 million <span class="caps">USD</span> secured for the endowment with fundraising now a primary focus. Kiribati has recognized the need to further build management capacity, particularly for surveillance and enforcement, and continues to do so through site, national, regional and bilateral partnerships. The link to the Nauru Agreement (8 Pacific Island States) to manage tuna fishing in the region are important and provide, through license provisions, the first active linkage to management of the neighbouring high seas for a World Heritage site. Kiribati licenses for fishing in the Kiribati <span class="caps">EEZ</span>, including <span class="caps">PIPA</span>, is only allowable if the licensee agrees not to fish in the adjacent high seas. This is enforceable through the mandatory 100% observer&nbsp;coverage.</p>

<p>2006: Establishment of <span class="caps">PIPA</span> announced at the 2006 Convention on Biological Diversity Conference of the Parties in&nbsp;Brazil;</p>
<p>2008: <span class="caps">PIPA</span> designated in its current extent by the Phoenix Islands Protected Area&nbsp;Regulations</p>
<h2 id="area"><span class="caps">AREA</span></h2>
<p>The property is 40,825,000ha. There are various clearly delimited zones within the&nbsp;property.</p>
<h2 id="land-tenure"><span class="caps">LAND</span> <span class="caps">TENURE</span></h2>
<p>The property is owned by the Sovereign State of&nbsp;Kiribati.</p>
<h2 id="altitude"><span class="caps">ALTITUDE</span></h2>
<p>From 6,147 m depth below sea level to nine m above sea&nbsp;level.</p>
<h2 id="physical-features"><span class="caps">PHYSICAL</span> <span class="caps">FEATURES</span></h2>
<p>The property comprises mainly ocean floor with a water column averaging more than 4,000m. An important feature of the marine environment is the abundance of large extinct underwater volcanoes, some rising more than 5,000m above the seabed. Beyond the volcanoes, the sea floor is flat terrain mid-ocean sea floor. The property includes all eight atoll and low reef islands of the Kiribati section of the Phoenix group: Rawaki, Enderbury, Nikumaroro, McKean, Manra, Birnie, Kanton and Orona. Their tops are all isolated peaks rising from the deep ocean floor (3,000m or greater) with several other presumed old volcanoes rising to near the surface, and many more known only from bathymetric study that do not reach to near the surface. Two known submerged reefs, Carondelet Reef, located 125km southeast from Nikumaroro, and Winslow Reef, located 240km northwest from the McKean Island, are shallow platform reefs with Carondelet Reef being as little as 3-4m underwater at low&nbsp;tide.</p>
<h2 id="climate"><span class="caps">CLIMATE</span></h2>
<p>The property is located in the Pacific equatorial dry zone that experiences droughts and periods of heavy rainfall. Most of the Phoenix Islands receive less than 1,000mm of rain annually with a dry period from March through June. During El Ni&ntilde;o periods, the Phoenix Islands may experience high rainfall. Air temperature ranges from 21.7&deg; to 36.7&deg;C (average 28.9&deg;C). Relative humidity ranges from 57% to&nbsp;85%.</p>
<h2 id="vegetation"><span class="caps">VEGETATION</span></h2>
<p>The islands have a sparse and species-poor vegetation cover. The low rainfall islands of the north and east support few or no trees, but a small number of grasses (e.g. <em>Lepturus</em>) and prostrate shrubs such as <em>Tribulus</em>, <em>Portulaca</em>, <em>Boerhavia</em>, <em>Sesuvium</em> and the parasitic vine <em>Cassytha</em> are present. The higher rainfall islands of the south and southwest do support indigenous forests, including <em>Pisonia</em>, <em>Cordia</em>, and <em>Pandanus</em>, with the forests of Orona being the most intact and extensive of the group. However, these southern islands also support coconut plantations that were planted during a resettlement programme between the 1930s and 1960s. About 20 to 30 species of plants are considered native to the islands. These include: <em>Digitaria pacifica</em>, <em>Eragrostis whitneyi var. typical, Lepturus repens, Cocos nucifera, Boerhavia diffusa, Sesuvium portulacastrum, Portulaca lutea</em>, <em>Cassytha filiformis</em>, <em>Tribulus cistoides</em>, <em>Suriana maritime</em>, <em>Triumfetta procumbens</em>, <em>Sida fallax, Ipomoea pes-caprae</em>, <em>Ipomoea grandiflora</em>, <em>Cordia subcordata</em>, <em>Tournefortia argentea</em>, <em>Morinda citrifolia</em>, <em>and Scaevola&nbsp;frustiscens.</em></p>
<p>The following natural vegetation types or communities have been recorded in the Phoenix Islands (local name in brackets; Mueller-Dombois and Fosberg&nbsp;1998):</p>
<p>1) <em>Pisonia grandis</em> forest - Nikumaroro,&nbsp;Orona</p>
<p>2) <em>Cordia subcordata</em> (te ango) forest and tall scrub &ndash; Manra, Kanton,&nbsp;Enderbury</p>
<p>3) <em>Scaevola taccada</em> (te mao) scrub &ndash; Manra, Nikumaroro, Orona,&nbsp;Kanton</p>
<p>4) <em>Tournefortia argentea</em> (te ren) scrub &ndash; Enderbury,&nbsp;Kanton</p>
<p>5) <em>Morinda citrifolia</em> tall scrub &ndash; Nikumaroro, Manra,&nbsp;Orona</p>

<p>9) <em>Triumfetta procumbens</em> (te kiaou) mat &ndash; Kanton,&nbsp;Enderbury</p>
<p>10)<em>Sesuvium portulacastrum var. griseum</em> mat &ndash; all Phoenix&nbsp;Islands</p>
<p>11)<em>Tribulus cistoides</em> mat &ndash; no island&nbsp;specified</p>
<p>12) <em>Lepturus repens</em> and <em>Lepturus pilgerianus</em> meadows &ndash; all Phoenix&nbsp;Islands</p>
<p>13) <em>Fimbristylis cymosa</em> (te uteute ni mwane) turf &ndash; Nikumaroro, Manra,&nbsp;Orona</p>
<p>14) <em>Digitaria pacifica</em> bunchgrass cover &ndash; no island&nbsp;specified</p>
<p>15) Mixed-species communities &ndash;&nbsp;Kanton</p>
<h2 id="fauna"><span class="caps">FAUNA</span></h2>
<p>Millions of seabirds have been reported for the Phoenix Islands which are well known as a key breeding site for many species of birds. Nineteen bird species have been recorded breeding within <span class="caps">PIPA</span> with a total population exceeding 1 million birds in the islands. There are important breeding colonies or concentrations of the following species: Audubon&rsquo;s shearwater <em>Puffinus lherminieri</em>, Christmas Island shearwater <em>Puffinus nativitatis,</em> Phoenix petrel <em>Pterodroma alba</em> (<span class="caps">EN</span>), white-throated storm-petrel <a href="http://www.iucnredlist.org/apps/redlist/details/106003975/0"><em>Nesofregetta fuliginosa</em></a> (<span class="caps">EN</span>), great frigatebird <em>Fregata minor,</em> lesser frigatebird <em>F.ariel,</em> brown booby Sula leucogaster, masked booby S. dactylactra, sooty tern <em>Sterna fuscata</em>, grey-backed tern S. lunata and blue-gray noddy <em>Procelsterna&nbsp;cerulea.</em></p>
<p>The Phoenix Islands also contain very important feeding grounds for at least 15 transequatorial and other latitudinal migrants, particularly petrels <em>Pterodroma</em> spp. and shearwaters <em>Puffinus</em> spp. from the Australasian region, notably: mottled petrel <em>Pterodroma inexpectata,</em> Cook&rsquo;s petrel <em>P. cookii</em> (<span class="caps">VU</span>), Pycroft&rsquo;s petrel <em>P. pycrofti</em> (<span class="caps">VU</span>), black-winged petrel <em>P. nigripennis,</em> Gould&rsquo;s petrel <em>P. leucoptera</em> (<span class="caps">VU</span>), collared petrel <em>P. brevipes</em> (<span class="caps">VU</span>), Juan Fernandez petrel <em>P. externa</em> (<span class="caps">VU</span>), sooty shearwater <em>Puffinus griseus,</em> short-tailed shearwater <em>P. tenuirostris,</em> Buller&rsquo;s shearwater <em>P. bulleri</em> (<span class="caps">VU</span>), flesh-footed shearwater <em>P. carneipes;</em> also streaked shearwater <em>Calonectris leucomelas</em> Two species of birds permanently found in the Phoenix Islands are listed in the <span class="caps">IUCN</span> Red List of Threatened Species: Phoenix petrel <em>Pterodroma alba</em> (<span class="caps">EN</span>) and white-throated storm-petrel <em>Nesofregetta fuliginosa</em> (<span class="caps">EN</span>); also bristle-thighed curlew <em>Numenius&nbsp;tahitiensis..</em></p>
<p>Terrestrial invertebrates include primarily arachnids and land crabs. Reptiles include marine turtles that nest on land. Other species of reptiles present include species of geckos and skinks. These were found on all Phoenix Islands except Birnie. Terrestrial mammals are primarily introduced and are considered destructive to native species of vegetation and birds. There are at least two species of rats and perhaps one species of mouse on various Phoenix&nbsp;Islands.</p>
<p>Dominant coral species on the outer reefs of the Phoenix Islands includes <em>Acropora</em> spp., <em>Pocillopora</em> spp., <em>Favia stelligera</em>, <em>Plerogyra sinuosa, Lobophyllia hemprichii, Porites</em> spp. and others. Within the lagoons, apart from the branching and tabulate <em>Acropora</em> stands, common corals include <em>Pavona</em> spp., <em>Montipora</em> spp., <em>Goniastrea pectinata</em>, and <em>Favia</em> spp., and in some locations beds of the rare coral <em>Anacropora forbesi.</em> Regional endemics include <em>Montipora capitata</em> and <em>M. dilatata)</em> the latter currently only known elsewhere from two small locations outside the Phoenix Islands. The motile invertebrate fauna of the Phoenix Islands is low in diversity, has a number of taxonomic gaps, and densities of large invertebrates are generally low. Kanton and Orona host spectacular small giant clam <em>Tridacna maxima</em> (<span class="caps">VU</span>) communities in sizes rarely seen elsewhere in the&nbsp;world.</p>
<p>The documented fish fauna of the Phoenix Islands consists mainly of shallow water species associated with coral reefs. The most abundant families in terms of number of species are wrasses (Labridae), including the napoleon wrasse <em>Cheilinus undulatus</em> (<span class="caps">EN</span>), groupers (Serranidae), gobies (Gobiidae), damselfishes (Pomacentridae), surgeonfishes (Acanthuridae), moray eels (Muraenidae), butterflyfishes (Chaetodontidae), blennies (Blenniidae), squirrelfishes (Holocentridae), and cardinalfishes (Apogonidae). A new species of damselfish, <em>Chrysiptera albata)</em> was collected in 42-50m depth at Nikumaroro Island (Allen and Bailey 2003). Other potential undescribed species were found in the genera <em>Myripristis</em> (Holocentridae), <em>Eviota</em> (Gobiidae) and <em>Trimma</em> (Gobiidae). Certain species are particularly common on Phoenix Islands reefs, occurring in much higher densities and full age/size cohorts than at most localities in the Indo-Pacific region. These include various surgeonfishes (Holocentridae), <em>Eviota</em> (Gobiidae), and <em>Trimma</em> (Gobiidae) <em>Acanthurus guttatus, A. nigricans, A. triostegus, A. xanthopterus, Naso literatus, Zebrasoma veliferum</em> and parrotfishes <em>Hipposcarus longiceps</em> and <em>Scarus ghobban.</em> Manta rays <em>Manta alfredi</em> (<span class="caps">VU</span>), polkadot cod <em>Plecropomus areolatus</em> (<span class="caps">VU</span>) and brindle bass <em>Epinephelus lanceolatus</em> (<span class="caps">VU</span>) are also&nbsp;found.</p>
<p>Globally threatened green <em>Chelonia mydas</em> (<span class="caps">EN</span>) and hawksbill <em>Eretmochelys imbricata</em> (<span class="caps">CR</span>) turtles and the following marine mammals have been sighted in the Phoenix Islands: Bryde&rsquo;s whale <em>Balaenoptera edeni</em>, <em>s</em>perm whale<em>Physeter macrocephalus</em>(<span class="caps">VU</span>), dwarf sperm whale<em>Kogia simus,</em>pygmy sperm whale<em>Kogia breviceps,</em>short-finned pilot whale<em>Globicephala macrorhynchus,</em>killer whale<em>Orcinus orca,</em>false killer whale<em>Pseudorca crassidens,</em>pygmy killer whale<em>Feresa attenuata,</em>melon-headed whale<em>Peponocephala electra,</em>Risso&rsquo;s dolphin<em>Grampus griseus,</em>bottlenose dolphin<em>Tursiops truncatus,</em>striped dolphin<em>Stenella coeruleoalba</em>pan-tropical spotted dolphin<em>S. attenuata</em>spinner dolphin<em>S. longirostris,</em>Fraser&rsquo;s dolphin<em>Lagenodelphis hosei,</em>rough-toothed dolphin<em>Steno bredanensis,</em>southern bottlenose whale<em>Hyperoodon planifrons,</em>Cuvier&rsquo;s beaked whale<em>Ziphius cavirostris</em> and other beaked whales (Mesoplodon&nbsp;spp.).</p>
<h2 id="conservation-value"><span class="caps">CONSERVATION</span> <span class="caps">VALUE</span></h2>
<p>The Phoenix Islands provide very extensive and important natural habitats for in-situ conservation of globally important oceanic biological diversity, both marine and terrestrial. The islands also provide important breeding, passage and/or wintering areas for a number of threatened migratory oceanic birds. The property represents a very important habitat for the continued existence of a number of other globally endangered (e.g. Napoleon wrasse, hawksbill turtle), vulnerable (e.g. bristle-thighed curlew, green turtle, giant clam, bumphead parrotfish, polkadot cod, brindle bass) and numerous other globally depleted species, both marine and terrestrial, including for apex predators such as sharks and endemic and fragile species associated with&nbsp;seamounts.</p>
<p>The large bathymetric range of the submerged seamount landscape provides elevation defined habitat types broadly representative of the mid oceanic biota. The property is of crucial scientific importance in identifying and monitoring the processes of sea level change, growth rates and age of reefs and reef builders (both geologically and historically), and in evaluating effects from climate&nbsp;change.</p>
<h2 id="cultural-heritage"><span class="caps">CULTURAL</span> <span class="caps">HERITAGE</span></h2>
<p>The Phoenix Islands present archaeological evidence of early colonization by both Micronesians and Polynesians, providing an important cultural link and an example of island voyaging over time. The Phoenix Islands could be considered an overlap area of these two important Pacific Islands peoples. Several islands in the group hold archaeological remains of settlements, guano mining and whaling/transiting ships from the 19th and early 20th&nbsp;centuries.</p>
<h2 id="local-human-population"><span class="caps">LOCAL</span> <span class="caps">HUMAN</span> <span class="caps">POPULATION</span></h2>
<p>The Phoenix group islands have no permanent inhabitants. The one currently inhabited atoll, Kanton, has a non-permanent population of approximately 50 people comprising government employees and their families engaged in protection and management of Kiribati interests in the&nbsp;region.</p>
<h2 id="visitors-and-visitor-facilities"><span class="caps">VISITORS</span> <span class="caps">AND</span> <span class="caps">VISITOR</span> <span class="caps">FACILITIES</span></h2>
<p>Currently very few visitors arrive to Phoenix Islands. No regular tourism visits are arranged at the moment. Occasional visitors are normally ocean going yachts and by special boat charters for recreational divers and various researchers. All visitors are mandated to apply for permits from the <span class="caps">PIPA</span> office (with associated fees) and to clear Customs and Immigration on Kanton upon arrival and departure from the country. This is working well for research and tourism operators but is as yet not sufficient for private recreational vessels visiting the islands. There are no facilities for visitors except for the local community&rsquo;s hospitality and some very old buildings left from <span class="caps">WW</span> <span class="caps">II</span> and the 1950s in&nbsp;Kanton.</p>
<h2 id="scientific-research-and-facilities"><span class="caps">SCIENTIFIC</span> <span class="caps">RESEARCH</span> <span class="caps">AND</span> <span class="caps">FACILITIES</span></h2>
<p>Research to study the seamounts and other volcanoes of the Phoenix Islands is on-going. The New England Aquarium has carried out a research expedition in 2009 to further study the seamounts. This organization also carried research on reef shark in 2002. Further on-going research is steadily revealing a previously unexpected high diversity of deepwater corals, albeit somewhat different formations to the shallow reef forming&nbsp;corals.</p>
<h2 id="management"><span class="caps">MANAGEMENT</span></h2>
<p>In August 2005 the Government of Kiribati (GoK) and partners New England Aquarium (NEAq) and Conservation International (<span class="caps">CI</span>) agreed a Memorandum of Understanding to design and establish the Phoenix Islands Protected Area (<span class="caps">PIPA</span>). From 2006 until February 2008 all activities were overseen and decided upon by the Phoenix Islands Steering Committee (<span class="caps">PISC</span>). With the adoption of the <span class="caps">PIPA</span> Regulations in 2008, giving full legal establishment to the protected area, the <span class="caps">PISC</span> is now formally established under law as the Phoenix Islands Protected Area Management Committee. Its membership is based on the earlier <span class="caps">PISC</span> and is inclusive of all government agencies (12) with a responsibility for the Phoenix Islands. The <span class="caps">PIPA</span>-<span class="caps">MC</span> is chaired by the Secretary of Ministry of Environment, Lands, and Agricultural Development (<span class="caps">MELAD</span>) and it meets regularly with meeting decisions and follow-up implementation well documented and reported by the <span class="caps">PIPA</span> Director. The <span class="caps">PIPA</span> Management Committee is tasked with finalizing a <span class="caps">PIPA</span> Management Plan within one year of the coming into force of the <span class="caps">PIPA</span> Regulations (i.e. by February 2009). A draft Management Plan has been prepared and is on track for finalization by this time. There are various clearly delimited zones within <span class="caps">PIPA</span> as described in the Management Plan (e.g. Zone 5 wherein purse-seining and long line tuna fishing may be allowed with a Kiribati Fisheries&nbsp;license).</p>
<p>Currently the Governments of Australia, New Zealand and France provide aerial surveillance of the Phoenix Islands area and positive discussions indicate that Australia and New Zealand will consider increasing surveillance and enforcement effort. Specific cooperation to assist with surveillance and enforcement technology and capacity building is under discussion with the <span class="caps">USA</span>&rsquo;s Papahānaumokuākea Marine National&nbsp;Monument.</p>
<h2 id="management-constraints"><span class="caps">MANAGEMENT</span> <span class="caps">CONSTRAINTS</span></h2>
<p>The existing management arrangements are not yet considered sufficient and work is well underway for a significant increase in resources, capacity and tools to ensure effective <span class="caps">PIPA</span> management. This currently&nbsp;includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Implementation of <span class="caps">PIPA</span> Management Plan (2010-2014), endorsed by Kiribati&rsquo;s cabinet in&nbsp;2009</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Full establishment of <span class="caps">PIPA</span> Trust Fund and associated structures under Kiribati Law. The Fund&rsquo;s legislation, the Board and by-laws are all now in place and 2.5 million <span class="caps">USD</span> secured for the endowment with fundraising now a primary focus. Further building management capacity, particularly for surveillance and enforcement, through site, national, regional and bilateral&nbsp;partnerships.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Implementation of agreed Phased Approach to capitalization of the <span class="caps">PIPA</span> Endowment and terms of Conservation Contract which cover compensation to GoK for tuna fishing access fees (commensurate with 25% closure additional to current zonation) and management plan implementation costs not covered by other&nbsp;grants.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="comparison-with-similar-sites"><span class="caps">COMPARISON</span> <span class="caps">WITH</span> <span class="caps">SIMILAR</span> <span class="caps">SITES</span></h2>
<p>The four island based natural World Heritage sites in the Eastern Tropical Pacific (Galapagos (Ecuador), Cocos Island (Costa Rica), Malpelo (Columbia) and Coiba (Panama)) are all centred on volcanic islands, contain no atolls and most of them have very limited coral reef development. Of the existing World Heritage sites situated in the Pacific, only Galapagos contains an isolated archipelago, none of which are atolls. <span class="caps">PIPA</span> reaches down to 6147m depth, thus containing all the deep sea habitats, while the deepest areas in Galapagos World Heritage site are only 3,600m. Galapagos does not contain atolls or significant coral reefs. The Great Barrier Reef and New Caledonia sites &ndash; indeed other barrier reef systems - are located on shallow continental or sub-continental shelves. Both contain extensive shallow water coral reefs but suffer from anthropogenic stresses and are at on-going risk of pollution (e.g. mining, eutrophication, shipping) due to their proximity to large land masses and shipping lanes. The reefs of <span class="caps">PIPA</span>, on the other hand, are in near pristine state and far from any significant sources of pollutants and other threats. Coral reef ecosystems are predicted to decline globally due to climate change. This highlights the global importance of <span class="caps">PIPA</span> for safeguarding the fragile coral reef ecosystems well into the&nbsp;future.</p>
<p>The Marine Protected Area that deserves closest comparison with <span class="caps">PIPA</span> is the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument of the United States, given that together they are the two largest marine protected areas in the world and both situated in the Pacific Ocean. <span class="caps">PIPA</span> has more biomass due to its location in the tropics whereas Papahānaumokuākea is situated on the edge of the tropics. Hence also the reef fish and stony coral species numbers are higher in <span class="caps">PIPA</span> (518 versus 250 and over 200 versus 57, respectively). The maximum depth of Papahānaumokuākea is less than 4,000 m with extensive areas much shallower while <span class="caps">PIPA</span> extends down to 6,147m with a mean depth of around&nbsp;4,500m.</p>
<h2 id="staff"><span class="caps">STAFF</span></h2>
<p>The <span class="caps">PIPA</span> Office and Director are based in Tarawa at the Ministry of Environment, Lands and Agricultural Development. There is currently no permanent government staff solely dedicated to the management of <span class="caps">PIPA</span>. The one staff member acting as the Director for the <span class="caps">PIPA</span> initiative is currently funded by supporters including Conservation International and the New England&nbsp;Aquarium.</p>
<h2 id="budget"><span class="caps">BUDGET</span></h2>
<p>The Government of Kiribati (GoK) contributes with significant staff time from more than 12 government agencies. New England Aquarium (NEAq) has provided and facilitated scientific and legal advice, as well as significant staff time to the <span class="caps">PIPA</span> project. Conservation International&rsquo;s (<span class="caps">CI</span>) Global Conservation Fund and Pacific Islands Programme continue to commit resources for <span class="caps">PIPA</span> design and operation. From 2004-2008 this amounted to more than \$450,000 <span class="caps">USD</span>. <span class="caps">CI</span> has committed a further \$420,000 <span class="caps">USD</span> for core <span class="caps">PIPA</span> operation from 2008-2010, secured a first contribution to the <span class="caps">PIPA</span> Trust Fund of \$2.5 Million <span class="caps">USD</span> (subject to match provisions) and, together with GoK and NEAq, is actively fund raising. A further \$57,000 <span class="caps">USD</span> has been secured from <span class="caps">CI</span>&rsquo;s Marine Managed Area Science Programme for deep sea assessments and connectivity analyses. The Critical Ecosystem Partnership Fund (Governments of Japan, France, MacArthur Foundation, <span class="caps">CI</span>, <span class="caps">GEF</span>) has provided initial funding for invasive species and seabird assessments (\$80,000 <span class="caps">USD</span>). The Government of Australia has been a consistent supporter of <span class="caps">PIPA</span> throughout its genesis. In 2006, Australia&rsquo;s Regional Natural Heritage Programme (<span class="caps">RNHP</span>) granted \$240,000 <span class="caps">AUD</span> for <span class="caps">PIPA</span> design and establishment. The Government of New Zealand (<span class="caps">NZODA</span>) has been the primary donor to the atoll restoration with a commitment of more than \$360,000 <span class="caps">NZD</span>.</p>
