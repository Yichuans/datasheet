## About World Heritage Datasheets

The natural World Heritage Datasheets have an illustrious past under the World Heritage Convention. They were part of the evaluation process when bulky nomination dossiers presented major logistic challenges back in the times - for every nomination a fully condensed, unbiased and digested information sheet was therefore requested by the Operational Guidelines and meticulously compiled for field evaluators and desktop reviewers - central to a systematic global evaluation process.

Over the years, thanks to the digital revolution in the 90s, nomination dossiers have become increasingly easier to access via the internet. Their usefulness has reduced in the evaluation process and thus shifted to focus on providing a snapshot at the time of inscription or major changes such as re-nominations, extensions or boundary modification. People continue to use and value them as concise, impartial and authoritative records. 

The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and the UN Environment World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC) are custodians of these datasheets. UNEP-WCMC undertakes the task of compiling newly inscribed natural World Heritage sites each year.

## This initiative

The datasheets are not without problems and accessibility is one of the most pressing ones. Being Word documents and PDFs, they are cumbersome to use and was made worse by having to download entire zipped packages even one only wants to access one. This severely affects the use in sharing, searching and analysing information embedded in them. 

The project aims to untangle decades of inconsistent practices, and to decouple content from formatting. We used [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org) to convert Word documents, using combined automatic and manual steps to resolve most of the hidden issues that prevent them from being accessible via the web. The end result is a massively improved datasheets product, delivered using the [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) format, and rendered in HTML. The datasheets themselves could be found in [this Github repository](https://github.com/Yichuans/datasheet-format-pelican-md).

Of course, we are limited by little time and resources, but there is so much more that could be done to further reach out to those who need them and truly unlock the knowledge deeply embedded in text heavy datasheets. 

This initiative is part of the new thinking to deliver information digitally at the [World Heritage Knowledge Lab](https://yichuans.github.io/wh-knowledge-lab/impact), a central hub for prototypes and working-in-progress analyses.


## Thanks

Many people have contributed to the making and maintenance of these datasheets in the past few decades.

[THE LONG LIST OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE CONTRIBUTED]

Special thanks go to John Ady, for his passion and dedication to the World Heritage Datasheets, at the age of 80.

We would also like to take this opportunity to thank other contributors who have helped us to develop, improve and maintain the datasheets, including IUCN mission teams, IUCN, UNEP-WCMC and UNESCO staff, as well countless local experts as well as NGO practitioners.
